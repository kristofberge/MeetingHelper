# MeetingHelper
An exercise in TDD and MVVM: A small app to help during remote meetings, created using TDD.
My goal is to create the entire app using TDD and to have as much code covered by unit tests as possible.. The app window will always be on top of other windows. This way it's easier to show several things on top of each other when sharing my screen during remote meetings.
For now the app has 2 functionalities: 
  - Showing an image: I use this to show the retrospective actions on top of other windows while sharing the screen during (remote) standup meetings.
  - Showing a timer that counts up or down: I use this to help timebox meetings like standup or retrospective.
